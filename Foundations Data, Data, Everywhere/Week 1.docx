•	In the "Ask" step, analysts defined the project, collaborated with leaders, and asked questions to understand the problem and goals.
•	In the "Prepare" step, they built a timeline, identified necessary data, and established data access rules.
•	In the "Process" step, they conducted an online survey, obtained employee consent, cleaned and secured the data.
•	In the "Analyze" step, the analysts found that hiring process efficiency and transparency were key factors in employee retention.
•	In the "Share" step, they shared the report with managers and ensured they had the full context to discuss results with their teams.
•	In the "Act" step, recommendations were made, including standardizing processes and conducting annual surveys.
